/**
 * Quantized BAAI bge-small-en embedding model that runs within your Java application's process.
 * <p>
 * Maximum length of text (in tokens) that can be embedded at once: unlimited.
 * However, while you can embed very long texts, the quality of the embedding degrades as the text lengthens.
 * It is recommended to embed segments of no more than 512 tokens long.
 * <p>
 * Embedding dimensions: 384
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to add "Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:" prefix to a query.
 * <p>
