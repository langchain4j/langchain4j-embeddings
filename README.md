# langchain4j-embeddings

Repository for LangChain4j's in-process embedding models. This repository is separate due to the large file sizes of the `.onnx` models.

To be able to run integration tests locally, you will need to have `.onnx` files downloaded from the LFS.
Please [install LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) and do `git lfs pull`.
